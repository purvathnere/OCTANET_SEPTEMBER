                <h3>Gokart 2K18</h3>
                <p>National Kart Racing Championship â€˜Gokart2K18â€™ was the debut event organized by Department of
                  Mechanical Engineering, Technocrats Institute of Technology, Bhopal from 21st to 23rd Feb
                  2018. The Championship witnessed the rise of the go-karting ethnicity and played an active
                  role in grooming the buddy engineers. The drudgery was very well reflected in the
                  manufacturing quality and the design techniques adopted by them in building their Go-Karts.
